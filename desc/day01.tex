This is the first day, so things are expectedly simple. For part two, there is one slight optimization from the trivial solution: If we consider the 3-entry windows, we can see that the sum of two consecutive windows $a_n + a_{n+1} + a_{n+2}$ and $a_{n+1} + a_{n+2} + a_{n+3}$ contain the common factor $a_{n+1} + a_{n+2}$. Hence, the only difference that can influence the sum of these two windows is that between $a_n$ and $a_{n+3}$, and to find the larger sum, it suffices to compare the two.
