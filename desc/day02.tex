Nothing too special about this day, no complex tasks to pick efficient algorithms for. Strict parsing and applying of constant-time modifications from start to finish, so linear runtime overall. But the ability for Javascript/Typescript to call methods directly by name comes in handy when reacting to text-based inputs, which are common in AOC challenges. It might not be pretty/safe/clean/readable, but it's fun. ^^
